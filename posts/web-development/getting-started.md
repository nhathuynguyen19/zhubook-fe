# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. In this post, I'll share some tips for beginners who are just starting their journey.

## The Basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Every web developer should start by mastering these three core technologies:

- **HTML** - The structure of web pages
- **CSS** - The styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - The interactive functionality

Once you have a good grasp of these fundamentals, you can move on to frameworks and libraries that make development more efficient.

## Choosing Your Path

Web development has many specializations:

- **Frontend Development** - Creating the user interface and experience
- **Backend Development** - Building server-side logic and databases
- **Full Stack Development** - Working on both frontend and backend

Each path has its own set of tools and technologies to learn. The key is to start with the basics and gradually expand your knowledge.
